Abstract
Colorectal cancer is a common and potentially deadly cancer that affects the colon or rectum.
Histopathological image analysis is considered the standard method used by pathologists to
classify colorectal cancers based on their differentiation types. However, the subjective na-
ture of these diagnoses increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis. In addition to images, in
recent years, there has been a growing understanding of the crucial role played by abnormal
microRNA expression in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer.
This thesis focuses on utilizing convolutional neural networks for analyzing histological im-
ages of colorectal cancer. The primary objective is to extract meaningful features that cap-
ture tumor tissue characteristics accurately and concisely. Deep learning models have demon-
strated remarkable performance in feature extraction, making them suitable for histological
image analysis. The secondary objective of this thesis is to explore the potential connection
between the features extracted from histological images and specific miRNA sequences. To
this end, FeatSee, a software developed by researchers at the University of Turin, is employed.
FeatSee utilizes machine learning algorithms to perform feature selection. By leveraging these
tools, the research aims to uncover important information about tumor tissue characteristics
and their potential relationship with miRNA subsequences. The findings contribute to advanc-
ing our understanding of colon cancer and may have implications for improved diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies in the future.
